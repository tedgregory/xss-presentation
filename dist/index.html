          <p> 
            Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into
            otherwise benign and trusted websites. <a href="https://owasp.com">OWASP</a>

        <section data-auto-animate>
          <p>
            The end user's browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the
            script.

            An XSS vulnerability allowing an attacker to modify a press release or news item could affect a company's
            stock price or lessen consumer confidence. <br> 
            An XSS vulnerability on a pharmaceutical site could allow an
            attacker to modify dosage information resulting in an overdose. And so on.

          <h2>Types of XSS attacks</h2>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            Early on, two primary types of XSS were identified, <b>Stored XSS</b> and <b>Reflected XSS</b>. In 2005,
            Amit Klein defined a third type of XSS,<br> which entitled <b>DOM Based XSS</b>.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>1. Reflected XSS (AKA Non-Persistent or Type I)</h4>
          <p>
            Reflected XSS occurs when user input is immediately returned by a web application in an error message,
            search result, or any other response that includes some or all of the input provided by the user as part of
            the request, without that data being made safe to render in the browser, and without permanently storing the
            user provided data. 
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>1. Reflected XSS (AKA Non-Persistent or Type I)</h4>
          <p style="color:greenyellow">For example when an attacker stores malicious script in the data sent from a
            website's search or contact form. </p>
          <p>As an example, this code </p>
          <img src="./test/assets/reflected1.jpg" alt="">
          <p>executed by a user will show a link with alert. Or
          <pre><code class="hljs" data-trim>'"><script>alert(context)</script></code></pre>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>1. Reflected XSS. More examples</h4>
          <p>onmouseover</p>
          <img src="./test/assets/reflected2.jpg" alt="">
          <p>onerror</p>
          <img src="./test/assets/reflected3.jpg" alt="">
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>2. Stored XSS (AKA Persistent or Type II)</h4>
          <p>
            Stored XSS generally occurs when user input is stored on the target server, such as in a database, in a
            message forum, visitor log, comment field, etc. And then a victim retrieves the stored data from the web
            application without that data being purified. The attack payload can be permanently stored in the victim's
            browser, such as an HTML5 database, and never being sent to the server at all.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>2. Stored XSS (AKA Persistent or Type II)</h4>
          <p style="color:coral">
            Examples of stored cross-site scripting attacks include the profile fields such as your
            username or email, which are saved on the server and displayed on your account page.
          </p>
          <p>For example, injecting the following</p> 
          <p><img src="./test/assets/stored1.jpg" alt="stored"></p> 
          <p>onto the website with high traffic can cause a DDoS attack</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>+ Blind Cross-site Scripting</h4>
          <p>
            Blind Cross-site Scripting is a form of persistent XSS. It generally occurs when the attacker's payload
            saved on the server and reflected back to the victim from the backend application. 
          </p>
        </section>
          <h4>+ Blind Cross-site Scripting</h4>
          <p style="color:coral">To increase the success
            rate of these attacks, hackers will often use polyglots, which are designed to work into many different
            scenarios, such as in an attribute, as plain text, or in a script tag. Here's a polyglot example <img
              src="./test/assets/polyglot1.jpg" alt="polyglot injection">

          <h4>3. DOM Based XSS (AKA Type-0)</h4>
          <p>As defined by Amit Klein, 
            <blockquote>
              DOM Based XSS is a form of XSS where the entire tainted data flow from source to
            sink takes place in the browser.
          </blockquote> For example, the source (where malicious data is read) could be the URL of
            the page (e.g., document.location.href), or it could be an element of the HTML, and the sink is a sensitive
            method call that causes the execution of the malicious data (e.g., document.write).

          <h4>3. DOM Based XSS (AKA Type-0)</h4>
          <p style="color:aquamarine">An example of DOM-based cross-site scripting attack would be when the website
            changes the language selection from the default one to one provided in the URL. </p>

        <h3>How to Prevent Cross-Site Scripting Attacks?</h3>
        <section data-auto-animate>
          <p>Attackers leverage a variety of methods to exploit website vulnerabilities. As a result, there is no single
            strategy to mitigate the risk of a cross-site scripting attack.</p>
        </section>
        <section data-auto-animate>
          <p>The concept of cross-site scripting relies on unsafe user input being directly rendered onto a web page. If
            user inputs are properly sanitized, cross-site scripting attacks would be impossible. There are multiple
            ways to ensure that user inputs can not be escaped on your websites.</p>
        </section>
        <section data-auto-animate>
          <p>Web application vulnerability automated tools/scanners can assist in finding XSS flaws. However they can't
            find all XSS vulnerabilities, hence manual code reviews are important. Manual code reviews won't catch all
            bugs, but it's the best proven strategy.</p>
        </section>
        <section data-auto-animate>
          <p>Code reviewer needs to closely review.</p>
          <p>1. That untrusted data is not transmitted in the same HTTP responses as HTML or JavaScript.</p>
        </section>
        <section data-auto-animate>
          <p>Code reviewer needs to closely review.</p>
          <p> 2. When data is transmitted from the server to the client, untrusted data must be properly encoded. Do not
            assume data from the server is safe. Best practice is to always check data. </p>
        </section>
        <section data-auto-animate>
          <p>Code reviewer needs to closely review.</p>
          <p> 3. When introduced into the DOM, untrusted data MUST be introduced using one of the following APIs:
          <ul>
            <li>Node.textContent</li>
            <li>document.createTextNode</li>
            <li>Element.setAttribute (second parameter only)</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section data-auto-animate>
          <p>Code reviewer needs to closely review.</p>
          <p> Code reviewer should also be aware of the HTML tags (such as <code>img</code> <code>src</code>,
            <code>iframe</code>, <code>bgsound</code> etc.) can be used to transmit malicious JavaScript. </p>
